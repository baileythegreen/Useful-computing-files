            <p>As sailboat captain, rower, flyfisher,  gardener, and Quaker naturalist, <strong>SUSAN  SCHMIDT</strong> writes poems about moving from dark into light as she plays in  boats and walks long trails. She remembers bright  parrots, big  trout, gales at sea, glaciers, peach pie, old  loves, Celtic ancestry, Civil War battlefields, and learning to  navigate. She has worked as science-policy analyst and professor of literature  and environmental decision-making. Susan now edits books, with the same mindfulness  as pruning apple trees, and walks beaches with her Boykin Spaniel, a Silkie  like her, happiest wet. Her Gettysburg poem  won the Guy Owen Poetry Prize. Her Carolina Parakeet poem appears in <em>Literary Trails of Eastern North Carolina.</em></p>

            <p><strong><em>Salt Runs in My Blood</em></strong> relates the poet&rsquo;s personal journey&mdash;mostly by boat. Observing  birds, she learns her own survival strategies<strong>. </strong>She travels to New Zealand, Alaska, the West Indies, but stays South  where she can name the trees and paddle year round. Vulnerable on land, she is more  confident on the water. The book could have been called &ldquo;The Watery Part of the  World&quot;.<strong> </strong></p><br>

            <p>Part I, &ldquo;Estuary,&rdquo; opens with the poet&rsquo;s Chesapeake homeplace; learning  to sail from her father whose ancestors were Chesapeake ship captains four  hundred years (salt), her mother&rsquo;s Irish side (soil and ink), Civil War generals,  and scuba diving. Falling as a rockclimber, she turns to paddling. Fleeing a scary  marriage, she goes to sea. &ldquo;Open Ocean,&rdquo; part II, follows her delivering  sailboats across oceans to the islands. In &ldquo;Pocket Water,&rdquo; part III, she  flyfishes in North Carolina mountains, leaves a tired romance, returns to  Virginia rivers. In &ldquo;Sea Level,&rdquo; part IV, the poet walks the Camino de Santiago  and settles on the Carolina coast where she survives hurricanes, rows and swims.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Reviews</strong></p>
            <p style="width:65%">&quot;If They  Came Our Way&quot; (Owen prizewinner) moves steadily, authoritatively, all the  while building a quiet intensity, right up to its stunning, unforced  conclusion. Sounds interweave, setting up a texture that pulled me in right  away. I admire this poem very much, its pacing, its lineation, its  careful yet emotionally wrenching detail.<br>
            &mdash;Kathryn Stripling Byer</p><br>

            <p style="width:65%">The opening line of <strong><em>Salt Runs in My Blood</em></strong> quotes a neighbor's advice: &quot;Remember where you come from.&quot; <strong>Susan Schmidt </strong>takes this to heart, exploring  deep roots in Virginia and North Carolina. She is an intrepid explorer,  approaching adventures with curiosity and wonder. Rarely do we  experience the natural world through the eyes of such a keen observer, who  understands the search for identity begins in the waters at home. With this lovely  book she earns our trust in her skill as a gifted poet and a guide down  the twisting river of the soul.<br>
            &mdash;Lee  Robinson</p><br>

            <p style="width:65%"><br>
            <strong>Susan Schmidt</strong>&rsquo;s poetry is tidal, seasonal, evolutionary. Traveling by wind,  muscle, and memory from the Chesapeake to the Camino de Santiago, she sings like  a Silkie with a human heart&mdash;about risk, loss, and resilience. Songs of her father  are personal and epic. She sights birds near extinction or already lost. Her  poems consider both her own fate and the planet. Schmidt writes a true line  that skims, like her boat, over the surface of time and place.<br>
            &mdash;Sandy Morgan</em></p><br>

            <p style="width:65%">Her eye for detail, her vision of the inner core of what she finds  in Nature, her ideas as they come through imagery: Susan Schmidt can be a  writer who matters.<br>
            &mdash;Richard Krawiec</em></p><br>
